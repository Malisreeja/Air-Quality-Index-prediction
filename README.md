# Air quality index prediction using machnice learning and data Analytics
# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using Machine Learning & Data Analytics

This project focuses on predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning algorithms and analyzing air pollution trends using data analytics techniques. The goal is to help monitor and forecast air pollution levels to support environmental awareness and decision-making.
